*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

This article describes the available support and troubleshooting options for Cloud App Security.

## Manage support requests for Cloud App Security

Microsoft provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support for Microsoft Cloud App Security. Support is available both online and by phone for paid and trial subscriptions.

As an admin, you can use the **Help + Support** option to file an online support request for Cloud App Security from the Azure portal.

-   Service administrator

Select **support request** to create a new support request that opens to the **Basics** tab of the Azure *Help + support* page by following the protocol below.

    -   **Problem type**: Choose your problem type from the drop-down menu

    -   **Problem subtype**: Choose the problem subtype from the drop-down menu

    -   **Subject**: Briefly describe the issue that you are having
