# Getting started with Cloud App Security
Cloud App Security can help you take advantage of the benefits of cloud applications, but maintain control of corporate resources. It works by improving visibility of cloud activity, and helping to increase the protection of corporate data. In this topic, we walk you through the steps you take to set up and work with Cloud App Security.  

Your organization must have a license to use Cloud App Security. For more information, see the Licensing resources section in [How to buy Cloud App Security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/cloud-app-security).  

>[!NOTE]
>You do not need an Office 365 license to use Cloud App Security.

With policies, you can create governance actions, and set data loss prevention and file-sharing controls.|
