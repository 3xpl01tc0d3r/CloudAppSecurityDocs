# Deploy Microsoft Cloud App Security

*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

Microsoft Cloud App Security can help you take advantage of the benefits of cloud applications while maintaining control of your corporate resources. It works by improving visibility of cloud activity and helping to increase the protection of corporate data. In this article, we walk you through the steps you take to set up and work with Microsoft Cloud App Security.  

Your organization must have a license to use Cloud App Security. For more information, see the [How to buy Cloud App Security](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/cloud-app-security) section on the Cloud App Security home page.  

>[!NOTE]
>You don't need an Office 365 license to use Cloud App Security.  

## Prerequisites  
  
- Your organization must have a license for Cloud App Security to use the product. For more information, see the [How to buy Cloud App Security](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/cloud-app-security) section on the Cloud App Security home page.  
  
     For tenant activation support, see [Contact Office 365 for business support - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/Contact-Office-365-for-business-support-Admin-Help-32a17ca7-6fa0-4870-8a8d-e25ba4ccfd4b).  
- After you have a license for Cloud App Security, you'll receive an email with activation information and a link to the Cloud App Security portal.  
  
- To set up Cloud App Security, you must be a Global Administrator, a Compliance Administrator, or a Security Reader in Azure Active Directory or Office 365. It's important to understand that a user who is assigned an admin role will have the same permissions across all of the cloud apps that your organization has subscribed to. This is regardless of whether you assign the role in the Office 365 portal, or in the Azure classic portal, or by using the Azure AD module for [Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt736914.aspx). For more information, see [Assigning admin roles in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Assigning-admin-roles-in-Office-365-eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504) and [Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-assign-admin-roles/).  
  
- To run the Cloud App Security portal, use Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge (latest), Google Chrome (latest), Mozilla Firefox (latest), or Apple Safari (latest).  

## To access the portal

To access the Cloud App Security portal, go to [https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com](https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com).  
You can also access the portal through the **Office 365 Admin center** by clicking the Admin centers icon. ![O365 admin centers icon](./media/o365-admin-centers-icon.png "O365 admin centers icon") Then select **Cloud App Security**.
