# Frequently asked questions

*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

This article provides frequently asked questions and answers about Cloud App Security.

## What kind of permissions do I need to access Cloud App Security?

You have to be a Global admin, Compliance admin, or Security admin in Azure Active Directory. It isn't enough to just have these roles in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center. You can use PowerShell to set a user as a Global admin, Compliance admin, or Security admin in Azure Active Directory. Run the following cmdlets below:

```powershell

 $cred = Get-Credential
 Connect-MsolService -credential $cred
 Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Compliance Administrator" -RoleMemberEmailAddress "XX@XX.XX"
```

 OR

```powershell
 Add-MsolRoleMember -RoleName "Security Administrator" -RoleMemberEmailAddress “XX@XX.XX”
```
