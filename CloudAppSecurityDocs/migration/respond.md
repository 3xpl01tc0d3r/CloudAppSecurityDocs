# Respond
  Insert introduction here.  
  
## Moving from detection to automatic remediation  
 After defining and customizing your policy filters, you can  select automated-governance actions that will be taken upon every violation of your policy.  
Since remediation actions leverage the cloud provider APIs, actions may vary from one app to another.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Take extra care when you set governance actions, they could lead to irreversible loss of access permissions to your files.  
> It is recommended to narrow down the filters to exactly represent the files that you wish to act upon, using multiple search fields. The narrower the filters, the better.  
>   
>  For guidance, you can use the **Edit and preview results** button in the Filters section.
