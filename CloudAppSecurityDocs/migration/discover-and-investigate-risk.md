# Discover and investigate risk
  After [!INCLUDE[Adallom](../migration/includes/adallom_md.md)] is up and running on your cloud environment, it's time to utilize the [!INCLUDE[Adallom](../migration/includes/adallom_md.md)] engine to investigate what's going on in your cloud so that you can start protecting your organization.  
  
 This section explains how to  investigate issues in your cloud environment and provides examples of what your daily process should be to manage risk for apps  that you monitor with [!INCLUDE[Adallom](../migration/includes/adallom_md.md)].  
  
 It's important to understand that this process is cyclical, meaning that while you must set up policies to start working with [!INCLUDE[Adallom](../migration/includes/adallom_md.md)], you will periodically return to the Policy center to fine-tune existing policies, and create new policies.

### Investigate  
  
-   Assess risk and compliance.  
  
-   Identify new requirements.  
  
-   Know your baseline using the activity log, file sharing, privileges, built-in reports.  
  
### Protect (periodically)  
  
-   In order for [!INCLUDE[Adallom](../migration/includes/adallom_md.md)]'s alerting and reporting features to work, it is necessary to [Control cloud apps with policies](../migration/control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md).  
  
-   It is also possible to automate prevention by setting up automated remediation.  
  
### Detect (daily)  
  
-   Check your alerts to see what violations were detected.  
  
-   Check your built-in and custom reports to see what's going on in your cloud environment.  
  
-   Drill down into the alerts and reports using the investigative tools to assess the nature of the violation.  
  
### Respond (daily)  
  
-   Notify, educate and migrate users.  
  
-   Govern violations by suspending access and removing permissions.  
  
-   Investigate and search for related issues.  
  
-   Dismiss false positive matches and update policies.
