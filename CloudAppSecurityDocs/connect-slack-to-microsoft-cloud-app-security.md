[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/banner.md)]

This article provides instructions for connecting Microsoft Cloud App Security to your existing Slack Enterprise Grid or Slack Enterprise Select using the App Connector APIs. This connection gives you visibility into and control over your organization’s Slack use.

## Prerequisites

* Your Slack tenant must meet the following requirements:
  * Your Slack tenant must have an **Enterprise Grid** or **Enterprise Select** license. Cloud App Security doesn't support non-enterprise licenses.
  * Your Slack tenant should have **Discovery API** enabled. To enable **Discovery API** for your Slack tenant, contact Slack support.

* The org Owner needs to be logged into their Slack organization within their browser before installing the connector.

## How to connect Slack to Cloud App Security

1. In the [Cloud App Security portal](https://portal.cloudappsecurity.com/), select **Investigate** and then **Connected apps**.

1. In the **App connectors** page, select the plus button followed by **Slack**.

1. In the pop-up, give the connector a descriptive name, and press **Connect**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > * The first connection can take up to 4 hours to get all users and their activities in the 7 days before the connection.
    > * After the connector’s **Status** is marked as **Connected**, the connector is live and works.
