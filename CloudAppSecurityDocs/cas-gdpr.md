# Microsoft Cloud App Security GDPR compliance

Microsoft Cloud App Security is GDPR-compliant along with all other Microsoft services and features. To learn more about Microsoft’s GDPR support, see [Licensing Terms and Documentation](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31).

Because this feature includes connectors on your SaaS services and on-prem appliances, there are a few events that you need to monitor to stay GDPR compliant. Cloud App Security stores the following data types, which can contain EUII:

- Activity log (activities performed by users in cloud apps)
- Activity log (activities performed by administrators in Cloud App Security)
- Objects metadata (including files metadata, user accounts, etc.)
- Discovery logs being uploaded to Cloud App Security 

There are two ways for you to stay GDPR compliant:

- View data with in-product capabilities

- Export requests as they arise

## Processing requests
The types of requests you are liable for:

- View – in-product capability to search for related entries
- Export
