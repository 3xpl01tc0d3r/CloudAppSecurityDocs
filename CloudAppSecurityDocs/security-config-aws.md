# Security configuration for AWS

*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

Microsoft Cloud App Security provides you with a security configuration assessment of your Amazon Web Services environment. This assessment provides fundamental security recommendations based on the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark for AWS.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Security Hub must be set up for all your AWS account regions. For more information, see [Setting Up AWS Security Hub](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2100208).
    > [!NOTE]
    > If this is the first time youâ€™re enabling Security Hub, it can take several hours for the initial data to become available.
- Your Amazon Web Services must be connected to Cloud App Security. For more information, see [Connect AWS to Microsoft Cloud App Security](connect-aws-to-microsoft-cloud-app-security.md).

## How to view AWS security recommendation

1. In Cloud App Security, browse to **Investigate** > **Security configuration**, and then select the **Amazon Web Services** tab.
    - Microsoft Cloud App Security provides recommendations for only the top 50 subscriptions.
    - It might take up to 15 minutes before your changes take effect.
