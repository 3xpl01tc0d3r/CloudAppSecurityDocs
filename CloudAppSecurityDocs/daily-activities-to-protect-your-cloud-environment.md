# Working with the dashboard

*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

This article describes what you should do with Cloud App Security daily.  After you get Microsoft Cloud App Security up and running, you'll need to:

- Configure data streams
- Sanction apps you want to allow people to use 
- Set up policies to monitor your cloud environment. 

You can then use Cloud App Security to control and protect your cloud and manage risk.  



## Check the dashboard  
The Cloud App Security dashboard provides you with an overview of activities and features, including:

- Open alerts
- Activity violations
- Content violations
- An activity map that plots where user activity originates
- Connected app usage trends in your cloud environment
- Top users by threat detection

We recommend you check the dashboard daily to see what new alerts have been triggered. It's a good place to keep an eye on the health of your cloud environment. The dashboard helps you get a sense of what's happening.
