# Microsoft Data Classification Services integration

Microsoft Cloud App Security enables you to utilize the Microsoft Data Classification Service natively, to classify the files in your cloud apps. Microsoft Data Classification Service provides a unified information protection experience across Office 365, Azure Information Protection, and Microsoft Cloud App Security, and allows you to extend your data classification efforts to the third-party cloud apps that are protected by Microsoft Cloud App Security, leveraging the decisions you already made across an even greater number of apps.

>[!NOTE]
> This feature is currently only available in the US and Europe (excluding France).

With no additional configuration required, when creating a data leak prevention
policy for your files in Microsoft Cloud App Security, you will automatically
have the option to set the **Inspection method** to use the **Microsoft Data Classification Service**.

To enable content inspection with Data Classification Services:

1. In the [file policy](data-protection-policies.md) page, under **Inspection method** select **Data Classification Service**.
2. Select whether the policy should apply when **any** or **all** of the criteria are met.
3. Choose your content inspection type by selecting the sensitive information types.

5. You can use the [default sensitive information types](https://support.office.com/article/what-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for-fd505979-76be-4d9f-b459-abef3fc9e86b) as well as the [custom sensitive information types](https://support.office.com/article/create-a-custom-sensitive-information-type-82c382a5-b6db-44fd-995d-b333b3c7fc30) (which support complex patterns with Regex, keywords, and large dictionary) that you created in Office 365, and reuse them to define what happens to files protected by Microsoft Cloud App Security.

6. Optionally, you can unmask the last four characters of a match. By default, matches are masked and shown in their context, and include the 40 characters before and after the match. If you select this checkbox, it will unmask the last four characters of the match itself.

7. You can also set alerts and governance actions for the policy. For more information, see [file policies](data-protection-policies.md) and [governance actions](governance-actions.md).

Setting these policies in Microsoft Cloud App Security enables you to easily
extend the strength of the Office 365 DLP capabilities to all your other
sanctioned cloud apps and protect the data stored in them with the full toolset
provided to you by Microsoft Cloud App Security â€“ such as the ability to
[automatically apply Azure Information Protection classification labels](azip-integration.md) and the ability to control sharing permissions.
