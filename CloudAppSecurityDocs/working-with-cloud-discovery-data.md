## Review the Cloud Discovery Dashboard

The Cloud Discovery dashboard is designed to give you more insight into how cloud apps are being used in your organization. It provides an at-a-glance overview of what kinds of apps are being used, your open alerts, the risk levels of apps in your organization. It also shows you who your top app users are and provides an App Headquarter location map. The Cloud Discovery Dashboard has many options for filtering the data, to allow you to generate specific views, depending on what you're most interested in, and easy-to-understand graphics to give you the full picture at a glance.

The first thing you should do to get a general picture of your Cloud Discovery apps is to look at the Cloud Discovery Dashboard and review the following:
 
1. First look at the overall cloud app use in your organization in the High level usage overview.

2. Then, dive one level deeper to see which are the top categories being used in your org for each of the different use parameters and how much of this usage is by Sanction apps.

3. Go even deeper and see all the apps in a specific category in the Discovered apps widget.

4. You can see the top users and source IP addresses to identify which users are the most dominant users of cloud apps in your organization.
5. Check how the discovered apps spread according to geographic location (according to their HQ) in the App Headquarters map.

6. Finally, donâ€™t forget to review the risk score of the discovered app in the **App risk overview** and check the discovery alerts status to see how many open alerts should you investigate.
  
## Exclude entities  
If you have system users or IP addresses that are particularly noisy and uninteresting or apps that are not relevant, you may want to exclude their data from the Cloud Discovery data that is analyzed. For example, you might want to exclude all information originating from 127.0.0.1 or local host.  
  
To create an exclusion:  
  
1.  In the portal, under the settings icon, select **Cloud Discovery settings**.  
  
2.  Click the **Exclude entities** tab.  
  
3.  Choose either the **Excluded users** or **Excluded IP addresses** tab and click the button to **Add user** or **Add IP address**.  
  
4.  Add a user alias or IP address. We recommend adding information about why the user or IP address was excluded.

## Manage continuous reports  
Custom continuous reports provide you more granularity when monitoring your organization's Cloud Discovery log data. By creating custom reports, it is possible to filter on specific geographic locations, networks and sites, or organizational units. By default, only the following reports appear in your Cloud Discovery report selector:  
  
-  The **Global report** consolidates all the information in the portal from all the data sources you included in your logs.  
  
- The **Data source specific report** displays only information from a specific data source.  
  
To create a new continuous report:  
  
1.  In the portal, under the settings icon, select **Cloud Discovery settings**.  
  
2.  Click the **Manage continuous report** tab.  
  
3.  Click the **Create report** button.  
  
4.  Enter a report name.  
  
5.  Select the data sources you want to include (all or specific).  
  
6.  Set the filters you want on the data, these can be **Organizational Units**, **IP address tags** or **IP address ranges**. For more information on working with IP address tags and IP address ranges, see [Organize the data according to your needs](ip-tags.md).

## Deleting Cloud Discovery data  
There are a number of reasons why you may want to delete your Cloud Discovery data. We recommend deleting it in the following cases:  
  
-   If you manually uploaded log files and a long time passed before you updated the system with new log files and you don't want old data affecting your results.  
  
-   When you set a new custom data view, it will apply only to new data from that point forward, so you may want to erase old data, and then upload your log files again to enable the custom data view to pick up events in the log file data.  
  
-   If many users or IP addresses recently started working again after being offline for some time, their activity will be identified as anomalous and you may get many false positive violations.  
  
To delete Cloud Discovery data:  
  
1.  In the portal, under the settings icon, select **Cloud Discovery settings**.  
  
2.  Click the **Delete data** tab.  
  
     It is important to be sure you want to delete data before continuing - it cannot be undone and it deletes **all** Cloud Discovery data in the system.  
  
3.  Click the **Delete** button.  
  
     ![delete data](./media/delete-data.png "delete data")  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The deletion process takes a few minutes and is not immediate.
