# Deep dive into discovered apps

*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

Microsoft Cloud App Security Cloud Discovery capabilities extend to resources that are hosted on IaaS and PaaS solutions such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Service, and Google Cloud Platform.

Running Cloud Discovery on resources provides you with visibility into which custom apps run on top of your IaaS and PaaS, into storage accounts that are created, and more.

Use this new capability in order to discover which resources are there, who accesses each of them, and how much traffic is transmitted.

To add resources to Cloud Discovery:

1. Select **Discover** followed by **Discovered resources**.
      Custom apps and storage accounts
              Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform
              Overall usage for each resource: users, IP addresses, transactions and traffic
              Note: only available for network appliances that include URL info
              For custom apps that users want to track closer, it is possible to create a custom app record in Cloud app catalog [ADD SCREEN CAPTURE]
