# Microsoft Cloud App Security compliance, trust, data security and privacy

Microsoft Cloud App Security is a critical component of the Microsoft Cloud Security stack. It's a comprehensive solution that helps your organization take full advantage of the promise of cloud applications, but keep you in control, through comprehensive visibility, auditing capabilities, and granular controls over your sensitive data.

With tools that help uncover shadow IT and assess risk, while at the same time enabling you to enforce policies and investigate activities. Microsoft Cloud App Security helps you control access in real time and stop threats, so your organization can more safely move to the cloud.

## Cloud App Security Compliance

In a world where data breaches and attacks are daily occurrences, it is essential for organizations to choose a cloud app security broker that makes every effort to protect their data. Microsoft Cloud App Security, like all Microsoft cloud products and services, is built from the ground up to address the rigorous security and privacy demands of our customers.

To help organizations comply with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements governing the collection and use of individuals’ data, Microsoft Cloud App Security provides a comprehensive set of compliance offerings (including certifications and attestations).

### Compliance framework and offerings

Microsoft Cloud App Security meets many international and industry-specific compliance standards including, but not limited to:

-   [EU Model Clauses](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/eu-model-clauses)

-   [HIPAA/HITECH](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/hipaa)

-   [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/iso-iec-27001)

-   [ISO/IEC 27018](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/iso-iec-27018)

-   [SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 Reports](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/soc)

## Privacy

### You are the owner of your data

-   You own your data and can cancel subscriptions and request deletion of your data at any time. If you do not renew your subscription, your data will be deleted within the timeline specified in the [Online Services Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31).

-   If you ever choose to terminate the service, you can take your data with you.

### Microsoft Cloud App Security is the processor of your data

-   We use your data only for purposes that are consistent with providing the services to which you subscribe.

-   If a government approaches us for access to your data, we redirect the inquiry to you, the customer, whenever possible. We have challenged legal demands that were not valid, which prohibited disclosure of [a government request](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/privacy/govt-requests-for-data) for customer data. Learn more about [who can access your data and on what terms](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/Privacy/Who-can-access-your-data-and-on-what-terms).

### Privacy controls

-   Privacy controls help you configure who in your organization has access to  the service and what they can access.

## Data location

-   Microsoft Cloud App Security currently operates in datacenters in the United States and Europe (each a “Geo”). Your tenant account will be created in a Geo based on the country you chose when you signed up. Specifically, your data will be stored in a data center in the Geo nearest to that location.

## Transparency

Microsoft provides transparency about its practices: sharing with you where your data is stored, affirming that your data is used only to deliver agreed-upon services, and specifying how Microsoft engineers and approved subcontractors use this data to provide services.

Microsoft uses strict controls to govern access to customer data, granting the lowest level of access required to complete key tasks and revoking access when it is no longer needed.

### Data Protection

Microsoft Cloud App Security enforces data protection when performing content inspection. File content is not stored in the Cloud App Security datacenter; only the metadata of the file records and any matches that were identified are stored.

### Data retention

Microsoft Cloud App Security retains data as follows:

- Activity log: 180 days

- Discovery data: 90 days

- Alerts: 180 days

You can learn more about Microsoft data practices by reading the [Online Service Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31).

## Security

### Encryption

Microsoft uses encryption technology to protect your data while at rest in a Microsoft database and when it travels between user devices and our datacenters.

### Identity and access management

Microsoft Cloud App Security enables you to limit access of administrators to the portal based on geolocation using Azure Active Directory to limit access. It is possible to require multi-factor authentication to access the Microsoft Cloud App Security portal by using Azure Active Directory.

### Permissions

Microsoft Cloud App Security supports role-based access control. Office 365 and Azure Active Directory Global admin and Security admin roles have full access to Cloud App Security, and Security readers have read access. [For more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/manage-admins).

## Customer controls for organizational compliance

### Do not track

Microsoft Cloud App Security enables you to set certain users to Do Not Track (DNT). This enables you to govern only specific groups using Cloud App Security, or to exclude specific groups from Cloud App Security governance.

### Anonymization 

You can choose to keep **Cloud Discovery** reports anonymous. After your log files are uploaded to **Microsoft** Cloud App Security, all username information is replaced with encrypted usernames. For specific security investigations, you can resolve the real username. Private data is encrypted using AES-128 with a dedicated key per tenant. [For more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/cloud-discovery-anonymizer).
