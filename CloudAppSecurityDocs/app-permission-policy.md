# App permission policies

In addition to the existing investigation of OAuth apps connected to your environment, Microsoft Cloud App Security is now gradually rolling out the ability to set automated notifications to let you know when an OAuth app meets certain criteria. For example, you can automatically be alerted when there are apps that require a high permission level and were authorized by more than 50 users. 


App permission policies enable you to investigate, for Office 365, G Suite and Salesforce, which permissions each app requested and which users authorized them. You are also able to mark these permissions as approved or banned. Marking them as banned will revoke permissions for each app for each user who authorized it. 
You can also define policies based on these filters. For example, you can be alerted any time an app requires a high permission level and is authorized by more than 100 users. 

You can also know if it's common, uncommon or rare in terms of community use, it can be helpful to see if you have an app that's unheard of that asks for lots of permission or permission from many users. You can create the policy either by clicking create policy from the app permission page or control ?>policy? App permission policy
