# What are the differences between Cloud App Security and ASM for Office 365?

> [!NOTE]
> For information about Advanced Security Management and Cloud App Security for Office 365, see [Get started with Advanced Security Management](https://support.office.com/article/Get-started-with-Advanced-Management-Security-d9ee4d67-f2b3-42b4-9c9e-c4529904990a).

## Cloud App Security 

The standalone version of Cloud App Security is a critical component of the Microsoft Cloud Security stack. It's a comprehensive solution that can help your organization as you move to take full advantage of the promise of cloud applications, but keep you in control, through improved visibility into activity. It also helps increase the protection of critical data across cloud applications. With tools that help uncover shadow IT, assess risk, enforce policies, investigate activities, and stop threats, your organization can more safely move to the cloud while maintaining control of critical data. 

## Advanced Security Management

Advanced Security Management is a comprehensive solution that enables cloud security across Office 365 Advanced Security Management. ASM enables global or security administrators to manage your organization's cloud activity more securely. After Advanced Security Management is turned on, the next steps are to define policies and alerts, learn about cloud usage in your organization, and manage apps that your organization uses with Office 365. All of this is done in the Advanced Security Management portal.
