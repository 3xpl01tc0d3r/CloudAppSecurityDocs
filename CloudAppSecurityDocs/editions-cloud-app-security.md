## Cloud App Security 

Microsoft Cloud App Security is a comprehensive cross-SaaS solution bringing deep visibility, strong data controls and enhanced threat protection to your cloud apps. With this service, you can gain visibility into Shadow IT by discovering cloud apps in use and you can control and protect data in the apps once you sanction them to the service. 

## Office 365 Cloud App Security

Office 365 Cloud App Security is a subset of Cloud App Security that provides enhanced visibility and control for Office 365. This includes threat detection based on user activity logs, discovery of Shadow IT for apps that have similar functionality to Office 365 offerings and control app permissions to Office 365.
