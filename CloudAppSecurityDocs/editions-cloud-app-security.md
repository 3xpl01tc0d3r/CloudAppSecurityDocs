# What are the differences between Cloud App Security and Office 365 Advanced Security Management (ASM)?

> [!NOTE]
> For information about Advanced Security Management and Cloud App Security for Office 365, see [Get started with Advanced Security Management](https://support.office.com/article/Get-started-with-Advanced-Management-Security-d9ee4d67-f2b3-42b4-9c9e-c4529904990a).

## Cloud App Security 

The standalone version of Cloud App Security is a cross-SaaS solution that provides Shadow IT discovery for unsanctioned apps, and for your sanctioned apps, it provides information protection, threat detection and conditional access across cloud applications in your organization. 

## Office 365 Advanced Security Management

Advanced Security Management is a subset of Cloud App Security that provides enhanced visibility and control for Office 365. This includes threat detection based on user activity logs, discovery of Shadow IT for apps that have similar functionality to Office 365 offerings and control app permissions to Office 365.
