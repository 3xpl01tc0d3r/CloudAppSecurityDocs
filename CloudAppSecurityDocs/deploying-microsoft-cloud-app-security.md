# Deploying Microsoft Cloud App Security
  [!INCLUDE[Adallom1](./includes/adallom1_md.md)] helps customers take advantage of the benefits of cloud applications while maintaining control through improved visibility of activity and increased protection over critical company data.  This documentation walks you through the following steps to work with [!INCLUDE[Adallom](./includes/adallom_md.md)].  
  
## Get started quickly with Cloud App Security  
  
|What you should do:|Task|Required?|How to:|Description|  
|-------------------------|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|  
|STEP 1. [Set up Cloud Discovery](../migration/set-up-cloud-discovery.md).|Upload traffic logs|Required|**Upload log automatically**<br /><br /> 1.   Go to **Settings** -> **Cloud Discovery settings**.<br /><br /> 2.    Click on **Upload log automatically**.<br /><br /> 3.   Add your data sources under **Data sources** tab.<br /><br /> 4.    Configure the log collector under the **Log collectors** tab.<br /><br /> **Upload log manually**<br /><br /> 1.    Go to **Settings** -> **Cloud Discovery settings**<br /><br /> 2. Click on **Upload log manually**.<br /><br /> 3.    Follow the steps to upload each log.|**Why should you configure log collectors?**<br /><br /> Gaining visibility into Shadow IT in your organization is critical.  <br />After your logs are analyzed, you can easily discover which cloud apps are used, by which people, on which devices.|  
|STEP 2. [Enable instant visibility, protection and governance actions for your apps](../migration/enable-instant-visibility--protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md).|Connect apps|Required|1.   Go to **Settings** -> **Sanctioned apps**.<br /><br /> 2. Click **Connect app** and choose an app.<br /><br /> 3. Follow the configuration steps to connect the app.|**Why connect an app?**<br /><br /> Only after connecting an app will you be able to gain deeper visibility to investigate activities, files and accounts in your cloud environment for your cloud apps.|  
|STEP 3. [Control cloud apps with policies](../migration/control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md).|Create policies|Required|**Create policies**<br /><br /> 1.  Go to **Control** -> **Templates**.<br /><br /> 2.    Select a policy template from the list and click  (+) **Create policy**.<br /><br /> 3.

In the **Policies** tab, click on the policy you created to see the relevant matches (activities, files, alerts, etc.).<br /><br /> Tip - Create a policy for each **Risk category** to cover all your cloud environment security scenarios.|**How can policies help your organization?**<br /><br /> Policies provide you with the tools to monitor  trends, see security threats, and generate customized reports and alerts. With policies you can create various governance actions, DLP, and file sharing controls.|  
|STEP 4. [General setup](../migration/general-setup.md).|Add your organization details|Recommended|**Enter email settings**<br /><br /> 1.    Go to **Settings** -> **Mail settings**.<br /><br /> 2.

Under **Score metric configuration** configure the importance of various risk values.<br /><br /> 3.    Click **Save**.<br /><br /> Now the risk scores given to discovered apps are configured precisely according to your organization needs and priorities.|**Why personalize your environment?**<br /><br /> Some features work best when customized to your needs.  <br />Provide a better experience for your users with your own email templates, decide what notifications you receive, and customize your risk score metric to fit your organizationâ€™s preferences.|  
|STEP 5. [General setup](../migration/general-setup.md).|Configure important settings|Recommended|**Create IP address tags**<br /><br /> 1.   Go to **Settings** -> **IP address tags**.<br /><br /> 2. Click on (+) **Add IP address range**.<br /><br /> 3.    Enter the IP range **details**, **location**, **tags** and **category**.<br /><br /> 4. Click **Create**.<br /><br /> Now you can use IP tags when creating policies, when filtering and when creating data views.<br /><br /> **Create views**<br /><br /> 1.  Go to **Settings** -> **Cloud Discovery settings**.<br /><br /> 2.    Under **Data views** click on (+) **Add data view**.<br /><br /> 3.  Follow the configuration steps.<br /><br /> 4.
