# Security configuration overview

*Applies to: Microsoft Cloud App Security*

Microsoft Cloud App Security provides you with security configuration assessments for your Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Recommendations cover all Azure subscriptions, AWS accounts including member accounts, and all GCP projects that are connected to your Cloud App Security portal. This organization-level view of all public cloud platform security configuration recommendations enables security admins to investigate security configuration gaps in one central location.

Use the following links to get more details about the different assessment types.
