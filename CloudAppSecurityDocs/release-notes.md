## Cloud App Security release 141

Released January 20, 2019

**Cloud risk assessment enhancements**
- Cloud app risk assessment was enhanced with two new experiences. 
    - A new **Data type** attribute assesses what kind of content users can upload to the app. You can use this attribute to assess an app according to the sensitivity of each data type in your organization. 
    - To get a more comprehensive risk overview of an app, you can now easily pivot from the app's risk assessment to the risk assessment of hosting company by clicking on the **Hosting company** attribute.

**Enhanced file context for anomaly detection alert investigation**
- Anomaly detection investigation was enhanced to enable you to see additional insight associated with the files that are involved in an alert. When alerts are triggered for file related unusual activity alerts (Download, Share, Delete), this drill-down is available. For example, if most of the affected files are from the same folder or share the same file extension, you will see these insights in the Additional risk section of the alert.

**Queries for file investigation**
- Cloud App Security’s ability to create and save custom queries was extended to the **Files** page. Queries in the **File** page enable you to create query templates that can be reused for deep-dive investigation. 


## Cloud App Security release 139, 140

Released January 6, 2019

- **Change in file detection**<br>
Files shared with everyone in SharePoint and One Drive are now considered **internal** [due to changes made to SharePoint and One Drive](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4089534/how-to-grant-the-everyone-claim-to-external-users-in-office-365). So if a file is detected that is shared with everyone, it will now be treated as an internal file – this affects how the file is handled by policies and shown in the files page.

- **Change in file monitoring**<br>
The default file monitoring behavior changed for new and idle customers. You will now need to turn on file monitoring to enable the feature, via **Settings** > **Files**. Existing active customers will not be affected by this change. 

- **Advanced tuning for anomaly detection policies**<br>
You can now affect the anomaly detection engine to suppress or surface alerts according to your preferences. 
   - In the Impossible Travel policy, you can set the sensitivity slider to determine the level of anomalous behavior needed before an alert is triggered. 
   - You can also configure whether the alerts for Activity from infrequent country, anonymous IP addresses, suspicious IP addresses, and  impossible travel should analyze both failed and successful logins or just successful logins. 

-	**Support for multiple trust chains**
Conditional Access App Control now supports adding and using multiple trusted root or intermediate certificates as a form of device management.

- **New Cloud Discovery role** (gradual roll out)
Cloud App Security now provides a new admin role for Cloud Discovery users. This role can be used in order to scope the access of an admin user to only Cloud Discovery settings and data within the Cloud App Security portal.

- **Support for Microsoft Information Protection unified labels** (gradual roll out)
Cloud App Security now supports Microsoft Information Protection unified labels. For customers that already [migrated their classification labels for the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/information-protection/configure-policy-migrate-labels), Cloud App Security will identify and work with these labels as described in [Integrating with Azure Information Protecion](azip-integration.md).

The custom log parser was enhanced to support additional and more complex web traffic logs formats. As part of these enhancements users can now input custom headers for headerless CSV log files, use special delimiters for key-value files, process Syslog file format, and more.
- **New anomaly detection policies**<br>
Suspicious inbox manipulation rules: This policy profiles your environment and triggers alerts when suspicious rules that delete or move messages or folders are set on a user's inbox. This may indicate that the user’s account is compromised, that messages are being intentionally hidden, and that the mailbox is being used to distribute spam or malware in your organization.
- **Support for groups in app permission policies**<br>
Cloud App Security now gives you the ability to define app permission policies more granularly, based on the group memberships of the users who authorized the apps. For example, an admin can decide to set a policy that revokes uncommon apps if they ask for high permissions, only if the user who authorized the permissions is a member of the administrators group.
- **Conditional Access App Control now integrates with your on-prem apps via Azure Active Directory Application Proxy**
  - The [Azure AD Application Proxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy) provides single sign-on and secure remote access for your web apps hosted on-prem.
  - These on-prem web apps can now be routed to Microsoft Cloud App Security via Azure AD conditional access to provide real-time monitoring and controls, via [access](access-policy-aad.md) and [session](session-policy-aad.md) policies.


## Cloud App Security release 133, 134, 135

Released October, 2018

- This release includes fixes and improvements for multiple issues. 

## Cloud App Security release 128

Released July 22, 2018

-	**OAuth apps actions across multiple apps**<br>
For OAuth apps that have been granted app permissions, you can now ban or approve multiple apps in a single action. For example, you can review all the apps that have been granted permission by users in your organization, select all the apps you want to ban, and then click ban apps to revoke all consent granted and will no longer allow users to grant permission to those apps.  For more information, see [Manage OAuth apps](manage-app-permissions.md).
-	**Enhanced support for Azure applications**<br>
For Azure, we are now gradually rolling out the ability to detect applications as user account activities performed by the Azure applications (both internal and external). This enables you to create policies that will alert you if an application performs unexpected and unauthorized activities. For more information, see [Connect Azure to Microsoft Cloud App Security](connect-azure-to-microsoft-cloud-app-security.md).
-	**Data Classification Engine updated with new GDPR sensitive types**<br>
The [Cloud App Security Data Classification Service](dcs-inspection.md) added new GDPR sensitive types to our Data Classification Engine to enable you to detect GDPR related content in your files.
-	**Updates to the Cloud App Catalog**<br>
The Cloud App Catalog now includes a legal risk category (in addition to General, Security and Compliance) to help you manage data privacy and ownership compliance, including GDPR readiness.
To help with assessing the GDPR readiness of each cloud app, the new risk category contains the GDPR readiness statement of the cloud service and status of each GDPR framework control.
Note that as part of this improvement, the following risk attributes were moved from other risk category to the Legal category:
     - DMCA
     - Data ownership
     - Data retention policy

     In addition, the new risk category is scored separately so you can configure the score weighting according to your preferences and priorities. For more information, see [Risk score](risk-score.md).

-	**New suggested query: GDPR ready** <br>
There is a new suggested query to enable you to identify discovered apps that are GDPR ready. Because GDPR recently became a top priority for security admins, this query helps you easily identify apps that are GDPR ready and mitigate threat by assessing the risk of those that aren’t.


## Cloud App Security release 127

Released July 8, 2018

- You now have the ability to see generic activities for Office 365 In the **Activity log** and in **Activity policies** you can now filter the Office 365 activities for **Unspecified** activities.

You can now create a Session Policy with an *Activity type* filter, to monitor, and block a variety of app-specific activities. This new filter augments the existing file download control features, to provide you with comprehensive control of the applications in your organization and works hand-in-hand with Azure Active Directory conditional access, to provide real-time visibility and control of risky user sessions — for example, sessions with B2B collaboration users or users coming from an unmanaged device. For more information, see [Session policies](session-policy-aad.md).
-	Gradual roll out: Cloud App Security's **anomaly detection policies have been improved** to include two new types of threat detection: Ransomware activity and Terminated user activity. Cloud App Security extended its ransomware detection capabilities with anomaly detection to ensure a more comprehensive coverage against sophisticated Ransomware attacks. Using our security research expertise to identify behavioral patterns that reflect ransomware activity, Cloud App Security ensures holistic and robust protection. Terminated user activity enables you to monitor the accounts of terminated users, who may have been de-provisioned from corporate apps, but in many cases they still retain access to certain corporate resources. For more information, see [Get instantaneous behavioral analytics and anomaly detection](anomaly-detection-policy.md).


## Cloud App Security release 120
Released April 8, 2018

In addition, the new policies expose more data from the Cloud App Security detection engine, to help you speed up the investigation process and contain ongoing threats. For more information, see [Get instantaneous behavioral analytics and anomaly detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/anomaly-detection-policy).

- Gradual roll out: Cloud App Security now correlates between users and their accounts across SaaS apps. This enables you to easily investigate all the activities for a user, across all their various correlated SaaS apps, no matter which app or account they used.  

-	Gradual roll out: Cloud App Security now supports multiple instances of the same connected app. If you have multiple instances of, for example, Salesforce (one for sales, one for marketing) you will be able to connect them both to Cloud App Security and manage them from the same console to create granular policies and deeper investigation. 

- The Cloud Discovery parsers now support two additional Checkpoint formats, XML, and KPC.



## Cloud App Security release 115
Released January 21, 2018

- This release provides an improved experience when selecting specific folders in file policies. You can now easily view and select multiple folders to include in a policy. 
- In the **Discovered apps** page: 
  - The bulk tagging feature enables you to apply custom tags (in addition to sanctioned and unsanctioned tags). 
  - When you **Generate an IP addresses report**, or **Generate a users report** the exported reports now include the information about whether the traffic was from sanctioned or unsanctioned apps.

## Cloud App Security release 114
Released January 7, 2018

- Beginning in version 114, we are gradually rolling out the ability to create and save custom queries in the Activity log and Discovered apps pages. Custom queries enable you to create filter templates that can be reused for deep-dive investigation. In addition, **Suggested queries** have been added to provide out-of-the-box investigation templates to filter your activities and discovered apps. The **Suggested queries** include custom filters to identify risks such as impersonation activities, administrator activities, risky non-compliant cloud storage apps, enterprise apps with weak encryption, and security risks. You can use the **Suggested queries** as a starting point, modify them as you see fit, and then save them as a new query. For more information, see [Activity filters and queries](activity-filters-queries.md) and [Discovered app filters and queries](discovered-app-queries.md).
 
- You can now check the current Cloud App Security service status by going [status.cloudappsecurity.com](https://status.cloudappsecurity.com) or directly from within the portal by clicking on **Help**>**System status**.
